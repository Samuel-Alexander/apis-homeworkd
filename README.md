## Building tools to support asset allocation decisions

This repo contains two financial analysis tools:

1. A personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

2. A retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then runs Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.
